# Jokeapp

An application written in Flutter, built for the web and android, which lets you browse jokes from a public API, [Jokeapi](https://jokeapi.dev/)

### Features

As you find more and more jokes, you can add them to your favorite collection. Access this list from the sandwich menu. There you can also find a settings page, which lets you filter jokes based on your preference.

## Technologies used

To manage HTTP requests and single-cache jokes, I use flutter_bloc. To provide the filter settings to the whole application, I use the Provider package.
